Deliverable #1

    Overview of Project:
        Real estate companies believe that in 2018 real estate will be online focused – more specialization with online postings is a must. Adoor incorporates these trends and lets the consumer focus on finding a house perfect for their needs. Adoor is different than the current real estate apps because it is more customizable. Current real estate apps use beds, baths, and price to show the user homes in a certain map area. Adoor will focus on the user’s exact needs, down to schools & distances to amenities, and show homes that fit those preferences. This means that Adoor lets the user just look at houses that already match your needs - all you need to focus on is if this house feels like home.
